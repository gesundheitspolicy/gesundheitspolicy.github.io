<p>Welcome to <strong>Gesundheitspolicy</strong>! The blog's name derives from <em>Gesundheit</em> (sans exclamation point), German for <em>health</em> and, well, the English <em>policy</em>.</p>

</p>Why not stick with one language, you may wonder. For one, the domain <em>healthpolicy.com</em> was already taken, and there really is no crisp German word for <em>policy</em> or <em>health policy</em> (a few <a href="http://dict.leo.org/dictQuery/m-vocab/ende/en.html?lp=ende&lang=en&directN=0&rmWords=off&search=health+policy">cumbersome analogs</a> exist). The perhaps more compelling reason is that I hope the blog's purpose to come true to its bilingual name: while Gesundheitspolicy will focus on health care in the US, it will draw on my journey from outsider to (budding) insider in the health care system, including the occasional post about health care in Austria, my home country.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">So who is this dilettante unable to stick to one language?</h2>

<p>My name is Max Pany and I am currently a medical and graduate student at Harvard University. Experiences over the past few years researching and thinking about health care have gotten me passionate about health policy and health care delivery issues. Iâ€™ve started this blog to consolidate and share some of my thoughts and musings.</p>

</p>I would love to hear from you!</p>
